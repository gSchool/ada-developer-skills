# Thursday 1/21: JS Ecosystem and Deployment Options in Capstone

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing the JS Ecosystem (TODO: LEARN LINK!) and [Deployment Options in Capstone](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PXoyAS12Ey8HvtykrE32Ae63FL-Nwwbi3ha251ZEG34/edit#slide=id.p)

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

  * A phone app?
  * A game?
  * A web app?
