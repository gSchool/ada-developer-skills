# Thursday 12/10: Testing and JS Adagrams

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing [Testing in JS](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/), [Closures](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/) and [JS Adagrams](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

### Let's start popcorn style with:
* What is one thing you have planned for the weekend?

### Guiding Questions and Concepts to Review:

* In the context of JS Adagrams, what new questions have emerged around Jest and testing?
* How have you approached structuring data for Wave 1 of JS Adagrams? How has your data structure ensured a weighted distribution (that is, how did you make sure you are more likely to draw and A than a Z)?
* How has approaching Wave 2 compared to Adagrams in Ruby? Is there anything about Javascript that makes the problem easier or harder?
