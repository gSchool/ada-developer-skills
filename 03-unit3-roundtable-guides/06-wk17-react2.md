# Tuesday 12/29: React

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing [Rests, Spreads, and Destructuring](#), [Intro to State](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1112/content_files/02-react-week-1/intro-to-state.md) and [EventHandling](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1112/content_files/02-react-week-1/events.md).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

### Guiding Questions and Concepts to Review:
### Rests, Spreads, and Destructuring
* Implementing rest and spread can look identical in JavaScript, but what's the difference?
* What are the advantages of using destructuring in React? What about spreading?

### State
* What's the difference between `props` data and `state` data?
* `const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)`
  * Explain what this line of code is doing?
  * What is `counter`? What is `setCounter`?
  * `counter += 1`. Does this work?
