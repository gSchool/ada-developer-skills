# Tuesday 12/15: Class in JS, Asynchronous Programming, and Axios

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing [Classes in Javascript](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1038/content_files/01-js-week-1/classes.md), [Intro to Asynchronous Programming](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1038/content_files/02-js-week-2/async-intro.md) and [Making GET Requests with Axios](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1038/content_files/02-js-week-2/axios-get.md).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a pot well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

### Let's start popcorn style with:
* Which do you like better: functions, or blocks?

### Guiding Questions and Concepts to Review:

#### Classes in JavaScript
* In what ways are classes similar and different in JavaScript compared to Ruby?
* Are reader and writer methods necessary in Javascript classes? Why or why not?
* How can attributes be added to an object that are not defined in the class?

#### Asynchronous Programming
* What are some of the benefits of asynchronous programming?
  * The drawbacks?
* Does JavaScript run asynchronous functions in parallel?

### Ada Pets Node
* What questions are there about the Ada Pets API?
* Let's have a volunteer or two share their code for `Wave 1: List Pets`

#### Axios GET Requests

* Why might you want to make a HTTP request from a web page?
* How are GET requests in Axios different from GET requests in HTTParty?
* Why is it often good practice to pass anonymous functions to `.then` and `.catch`.
