# Tuesday 12/15: Classes in JS and Axios

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing [Classes in Javascript](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1038/content_files/01-js-week-1/classes.md), [Intro to Asynchronous Programming](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1038/content_files/02-js-week-2/async-intro.md) and [Making GET Requests with Axios](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1038/content_files/02-js-week-2/axios-get.md).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!
