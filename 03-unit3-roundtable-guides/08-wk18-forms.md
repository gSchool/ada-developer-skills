# Tuesday 1/5: React Forms

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing [React Forms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1112/content_files/02-react-week-1/forms.md) and [Advanced Forms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

### Guiding Questions and Concepts to Review:
* What is the difference between **controlled** and **uncontrolled** forms?
    * What are the advantages then of letting React control the form?
* When a user types into an input field, how is that data captured?
* Once a form is "submitted," what role does `e.preventDefault()` play in that?

#### React Forms Exercise
* Here is a [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/reverent-golick-8pmes) with an uncontrolled form. Let's build it out!

#### BONUSES!
* Submit button is disabled until all fields are valid.
* Email address should be valid.
