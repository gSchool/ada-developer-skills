At Ada, we list that part of the requirements of the program are completing:

- All required class projects - green or yellow (red = review or redo)
- CS Fundamentals - 100% completion of assignments
- All required PSEs
- All required curriculum lessons and checkpoints on Learn

You are expected to turn in every assignment and project. Assignments are expected to be complete and meet all base expectations.

## Red, Yellow, Green

You will receive feedback for almost every project you complete at Ada. In project feedback, you will not receive a grade, but a color rating.

Here's what the colors mean:

Color  | Meaning                   | What we're seeing
---    | ---                       | ---
Green  | Meets or exceeds standard | All/most of the learning goals were met. The submission shows a reasonable level of polish. There are no major concerns.
Yellow | Approaches standard       | Most learning goals were met. Project may have been submitted with substantial bugs, or with some minor features missing. There's room for improvement, so we ask that you look at the feedback and ask any questions about feedback that's unclear how to move forward with.
Red    | Not at standard           | One or more major learning goal was missed. Project is missing a big feature. It's possible that the code does not run.

The checklist of requirements is in the repo for each project in a file called `feedback.md`. We encourage to take a look at this during every project. If you missed a requirement, we'll usually include a note about what went wrong.

Inline comments will be about specific things we see as we read your code that aren't covered by the checklist.

## Redos or Reviews on Reds

If you get a "Red" rating on a project, you and an instructor will have a conversation and check-in about the project. Your instructor will ask you to redo the entire project, redo parts of it, or review it with them by a certain date.

## Addressing Concerns

If you ever feel that you are falling behind or need extra attention, you are expected to keep instructors and/or the Program Manager, Student Services in the loop.

Instructors will provide feedback on student progress through various channels (instructor 1-1s, qualitative progress reports, code reviews, and informal feedback during project time). They will identify areas where performance should be improved.

Interventions will be made if a studentâ€™s progress in the program deviates from expectations. If interventions are unsuccessful, a plan for support and improvement will be created by you and Ada staff. **Academic Dismissal from the program will become an option only if academic interventions, counselor support, and improvement plans are unsuccessful.**
