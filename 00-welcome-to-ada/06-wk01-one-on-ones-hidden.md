# How to Conduct a One-on-one Meeting

One of the responsibilities for instructors is to conduct one-on-one meetings with students.


## Logistics

With a cohort size of 52 students with 5 classroom instructors, the traditional cadence is such: Each student should meet with one instructor once every two weeks. Therefore, instructors should conduct 5-6 one-on-ones each week.

The current method that instructors use to schedule one-on-ones is to: 
- Create blocks of time setup for 20 minute appointments onto your personal Ada calendar.
- To the extent possible, slots should reoccur 3 times, every other week (for example, a single student should meet with an instructor Tuesday at 2pm on Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6).
- Email students with the link to your calendar to sign up for a slot.

Some thoughts:

- Scheduling one-on-ones should happen during lab time, and not during scheduled events, lunch, or after-hours.
- One-on-ones will start in week 2.
- One-on-one pairings will change 3 times during the cohort (Ruby, Rails, and Javascript)

### Key Guidelines

- When emailing your students, **every email to students must include all email addresses by BCC.** Students have not consented to sharing their personal email addresses to each other, so it's crucial to preserve that privacy
- Notes from each one-on-one meeting will be recorded in a specified Airtable. After each meeting, students should receive a indicator "On Radar", "On Target", "Trending Up", "Trending Down".  
- If a students is "On Radar" or "Trending Down", you should mention this at our daily stand-up so that we can talk how to best support this student.

## The Nature of One-on-Ones

Things that should definitely be established consistently in each one-on-one:

- Ensure that it is a private, non-judgmental space
- Absolutely give positive feedback in each meeting
  - What have they done well in projects?
  - What have they done well in the classroom setting?
  - How have they done well in regards to the Ada Bar?
  - How have they done well in studying, asking questions, participating?
  - How have they improved?
- Discourage students from comparing themselves to others
- A lot of students want to know how they are doing in the curriculum overall. Feel free to gently and professionally tell them â€” there are no secrets! If a student is meeting expectations, share that with them
- Encourage them to stay focused on the task at hand
- Find resources to help them or further their interests, questions, and curiosity
- Find resources and the right people to help them that aren't you
- Give constructive feedback
- Keep them accountable to feedback given and commitments made
- Give them an accurate picture of how they are doing and how they could improve
  - It is not uncommon for unconscious racial bias to cause educators to be more scarce on constructive-critical feedback to URM students, further exacerbating inequitable outcomes. Be intentional about offering opportunities for growth to all students and mindful of unconscious biases that may hurtfully lower your expectations of some students.

## What to actually talk about

Things that should definitely be asked consistently each one-on-one:

- Answer technical questions
- Answer classroom questions
- Answer career questions
- If the student is in tutoring, ask how tutoring is going
- If the student is not in tutoring, ask if they would like a tutor
- If the student is not in tutoring and you would like to recommend them to tutoring, ask how they would feel about that
- Ask how the project is going
- Ask how the classroom is going
- Ask about any capstone ideas (encourage students to think about capstone ideas so they aren't without ideas at the beginning of capstone, but to not worry about capstone logistics yet)
   - Students may start thinking about capstone early in the cohort, but instructors do not need to bring this up until capstones are formally introduced.
- Ask how study skills are:
  - Do they need to up their vocabulary?
  - Do they need to practice their fundamental concepts?
  - Do they need to practice rehearsal of facts? (How do you access ..., how do you make ... )
  - Do they need to rely less on copy/paste?
  - Do they need to pre-read the lecture the night before?
  - Suggest flash cards
  - Suggest making diagrams
  - Suggest some of our optional worksheets that are littered around our curriculum

### Other things to consider

- If they have personal issues, see what can apply to classroom environment, and/or recommend them to talk with Sarah (more)
- If they need an accommodation (medical), ask them to talk with Sarah
- If they are on the path to a Learning Plan, is this the time to bring it up?

#### Internships

It's super fair game to talk about internships! This particularly is useful to remember once company engagement starts, or when MediaRanker happens because that's when students reflect on their workstyle.

Instructors have a small amount of data that they can collect/pass along to the internship coordination process. Things worth asking in one-on-ones is pretty generic:

- What specific thoughts do you have about internship?

To be perfectly transparent, the internship coordination process takes into account the following axes that instructors can provide input for (though not necessary, and not necessary to collect via 1:1):

- Independence
- Needing support
- Needing other Adies
- Location/commute
- Inclination/preference for pairing

## Conclusion

One-on-ones are an important way to check-in with students. The best principles we have for our one-on-ones include:

- Ask the student to lead the one-on-one with their needs
- Make sure that you bring up the points of tutoring, capstones, and ways to improve
- Make sure that the one-on-ones are built on privacy and trust
- Be consistent, follow up on action items, document everything important
