# How to Conduct a Weekly Project Review

At least for C14, we will have a cadence of holding a classroom project review at the start of each week.
This is just a brief document to refer back to when preparing for or while facilitating a Project Review

## General Outline

1. Ask students how the project was for them. This is to create space to for the class to reflect and exhale at the end of the project. Try to cut this off at around 5 minutes max. (If there seem to be a lot of strong feelings - especially negative - we may want to find a way to get more feedback on the project, but this is not the time for that.)
1. [_Skip if the project does not contain multiple waves._] Create a quick poll to gauge which wave of the project has the most interest. The poll should simply give each wave as an option. (Creating polls in Zoom is done from the browser and a little weird. You may want to experiment with creating a poll **before** the review session.)
1. Ask students to share their code for the wave that has the most interest. If there are multiple waves that have a high level of interest, try to make time for discussion of those waves as well.

## Notes
When asking students to share code, remind them often that this is a space where it's safe for people to be wrong, and especially a space where its safe to have imperfect code. We as a staff cannot emphasize to them enough that we all learn from seeing how other people solved a problem.
