## ü§î Mission ü§î

Before we get into why _you're_ here, let's get into why _Ada Developer's Academy_ is here, and look at its mission statement.

> Ada Developers Academy is a non-profit, tuition-free coding school for women and gender diverse adults. We focus on serving low income people, underrepresented minorities, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.

Ada Developers Academy has a very specific audience that it fights for.

> Ada develops software engineers who are skilled, confident, and work-tested; our graduates are experienced in practical, team-based software development and learning new technology rapidly.

Our goal is for everyone to be skilled, confident, and work-tested, collaborative, practical software developers.

> Diverse teams create more effective work cultures and innovative products. Ada advocates for and supports our students, alums, and partners to build healthy, equitable environments and a more inclusive tech industry.

We fiercely believe that caring for our students, alums, and partners, will create a more diverse, healthy, equitable, and inclusive tech industry.

# You're in the Core Program... Now What?

As we're sure you know, the core program is an 11-months learning experience. It is divided into two sections:

1. The Classroom Portion: 6 months
2. The Internship Portion: 5 months

# üçé The Classroom Portion üçé

The following beliefs shape our classroom portion and the methods/activities/projects we do.

We believe...

1. That high engagement and frequent engagement with the material is effective. We will do a lot of reading, watching, repeated practicing, deep discussion, question-asking, researching, and reviewing with each other
1. That you yourself can take charge and ownership into transforming yourself into a developer
1. Communication and being human matter the most
1. Everything points to something larger

Please refer to your Student Handbook for details on:

- overall program schedule
- days/weeks when class is not in session


## üìö Scheduled Units üìö

We will cover the following subjects (in detail on [this page](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/classroom/syllabus.md))

1. **Programming Fundamentals in Ruby** (6 Weeks)
1. **Static Web** (1 Week)
1. **Servers as APIs and Full-Stack Development** (6 Weeks)
1. **Learning Your Second Language: JavaScript** (2 Weeks)
1. **Front-End Development: React** (3 Weeks)
1. **Independent Capstone Project** (4 Weeks: 1 individual self-study week, 3 weeks of development)

We operate on a rolling schedule release: Every week, we will set the schedule on the classroom calendar for 2 weeks in advance.

## üåâ Support From the Education Team üåâ

The following is a list of things we'll do a lot of at Ada:

1. Developing your progress with 1:1 Meetings
1. Completing projects, and receiving project feedback
1. Getting help with TAs
1. Getting help with Tutors
1. Working through Individualized Learning Plans (LPs)

### 1:1 Meetings

1:1 meetings (one-on-one meetings) between you and an instructor will happen regularly. It is your time to discuss:

- any questions you have
- reteach or review any material
- talk about study skills, blockers, struggles, successes, challenges
- give or receive any thoughts, wisdom, feedback, advice
- talk about any other ways to support your software-developery-ness

You will be assigned an instructor to meet with regularly. Your 1:1 instructor will rotate regularly.

We'll learn more details when we begin the 1:1 meeting process in week 2.

### Projects, and Project Feedback

We'll do a lot of coding at Ada! (Who knew?!)

We will often assign individual and group projects. Instructors on the Education Team will often give feedback on your code.

We'll learn more details when we start and submit our first project in week 2.

### TAs and Tutors

Our community has a lot of excited, engaged TAs (teaching assistants) and tutors who are here to learn with you and help you. Please use Slack and our student support/student services team to get access to them!

### Individualized Learning Plans (LPs)

In its current stage, the Ada Core program doesn't have a lot of [differentiated instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction).

If **you yourself OR an Education Team staff member** see a need for a short-term individualized learning plan to aid in your success in the Ada program, we can easily set one up!

Individualized Learning Plans often address:

- Transitioning into a self-guided, intensive learning environment
- Making up on learning certain/specific programming concepts
- Making up on projects
- Making up on attendance and/or participating in the program

Individualized Learning Plans often create structure, care, and accountability on any of the following or more:

- Adjusted/increased/specialized 1:1 meetings with instructors, student services folks, tutors, mentors, alum, or more!
- Adjusted project requirements
- Adjusted project due dates
- Adjusted attendance requirements due to specific, temporary circumstances
- Adjusted/increased/specalized talks about content review, study skills, etc.

We can create these Learning Plans any time-- just let any Ada staff member know through Slack.

## üìû Support From Tools & Communication üìû

Please expect and be responsive (check once per work day) to the following tools that Ada staff will use to communicate with you:

1. Slack
1. Email
1. Learn LMS
1. Zoom
1. Google Calendar
1. GitHub.com

# üñ• The Internship Portion üñ•

After the classroom portion, you will spend 5 months with one of Ada's company partners for an assigned internship.

Details about what this means and how it happens will come later during the classroom portion.

During the classroom portion, look forward to communication about:
- Introduction to Internship
- Company Engagement
- Interview Preparation
- Workshops from community members about professional development

# üéì Graduation üéì

Graduation comes after the internship portion, and on successful completion of the graduation requirements listed in the Student Handbook.

At that point, you will join the Ada Alum network.

# üíå Note from the Education Team: Asking for Grace üíå

Hello C14!

We also wanted to give a personal letter to you, from the Education Team at Ada! We were hoping to share some feelings about uncertainty, and ask for grace from you all.

What do you all think about the program so far?

While we've now run one very successful cohort that spent 18 weeks learning online (thank you, C13!), you, C14, are the first cohort that Ada has ever begun completely online.

We are sad and anxious, as this online experience may not be what you expected for learning programming, and it will be very different from how you experienced school, education, or learning in the past.

We're nervous because we _will_ not make the best decisions all the time, and we will need to collaborate, reflect, and evolve with you this year.

However, learning programming in an online format is genuinely one of the best and most exciting things we can imagine. Not only are we living in the future, but we are _forming_ the future.

As the Ada staff work towards making the best learning experience yet, we ask that you, C14, give us support, patience, grace, understanding, and loving and critical feedback as we work through the road bumps.

We're in this together! Let's stay in this together, and make it good and great together, too.

-- Education Team, August 2020
