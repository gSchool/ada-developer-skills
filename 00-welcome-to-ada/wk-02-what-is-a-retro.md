# What is a Retrospective?


"Agile" is a set of methodologies and processes of software development. In Agile, a sprint is a phase of a project.  A project is completed over many sprints. Agile teams conduct a _retrospective_ after each sprint. This is an opportunity to examine how the team is working together. It's a mediated conversation about the process by which the team is accomplishing its tasks and goals. 

_Side-note: We often use a different word like "iteration" instead, as "sprint" can imply moving at lightning speed all the time, which isn't a healthy long-term work environment._

We will get more into depth about Agile software development over the curriculum.

## Our Retros

Retros can vary a lot in format. At Ada, we will do the following process:

### Preparation During the Week

During the week, whenever it wouldn't disrupt other classroom activities, add your thoughts and observations to the retro board. We will use the four categories below to classify our experiences and things that we want to acknowledge or discuss:

1. What went well?
1. What could be improved?
1. Positive Experiences & Appreciation!

### Retro Process

 **Pre-Meeting:** Before the meeting, students write sticky notes for any or all of the 3 categories before the meeting

#### Meeting Flow
1. Weekly Announcements, if we have any. (These should also be sent out to students on Slack shortly before Retro)
1. Read the "Prime Directive" (see next section)
1. Read Appreciations (from Airtable)
1. Review the past week’s calendar
1. ~5 minutes of silence for everyone to vote on “What worked well?” and “What can be improved?”
1. Read everything in the “What went well?” column 
1. Spend time talking about the one item(s) that gets the most votes in the “What could be improved?” column. 
    - We can potentially do a 2nd if there's a tie
    - The purpose of limiting the topics in this column is to ensure the most pressing improvements get the air time they need.
1. Pep Talk (Initial one led by staff member, all others led by students)
1. Preview of upcoming week

## Facilitation

One of the most common fears people have when first trying a retrospective is that the ritual will become a negative gripe session, interspersed with blame and counter blame. Those can be cathartic, but they won't contribute to learning nor help us improve our classroom experience. We will intercept and counteract those fears with the __Retrospective Prime Directive__:

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

There will always be a facilitator during retro. At Ada, the facilitator will likely be an instructor. The facilitator's job during retro is to moderate the conversation. They will try to stop the group from getting into the weeds, and do their best to give everyone the same opportunity to be heard. Specifically, their job is to:

1. Set the Stage and introduce process
1. Gather Data -> read organized notes, provide context (if necessary), 
1. Generate Insights -> lead discussion, suggest actionable items (if appropriate)
1. Decide What to Do -> Is recognition enough? Is there an action item someone gets?
1. Close the Retrospective -> Respect people's time
