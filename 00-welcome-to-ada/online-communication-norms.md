# üíª Online Communication Norms at Ada üíª

## üìπ Audio/Video Communication (aka Zoom)

1. **Have your video camera on** as much as possible
    - This allows for attentive engagement, body language, and shared sense of belonging

1. Update your [Zoom profile settings](https://us02web.zoom.us/profile) so that **your name conforms to this template and includes your pronouns: `Name (pronouns)`**
    - For example, Simon's Zoom name is `Simon (they/them)`, Becca's is `Becca (she/they)`, Devin's is `Devin (she/her)`, and Chris's is `Chris (he/him)`

1. **Use the Chat feature** for on-topic conversation and questions
    - This is our best way to hear your questions!

1. **Keep yourself on mute until you're ready to speak**
    - This eliminates audio feedback and distraction

1. **Set your Zoom avatar to be an image that represents your appearance (so we can recognize you!)**
    - Consider a photo of yourself or a cartoon avatar that resembles you.

### Tips

- Use the Reactions feature of Zoom!
- You can enable remote access through Zoom-- a feature that will let someone else on the Zoom call control your computer temporarily. Sometimes we will do this at Ada!
- Tools you can use to generate a cartoon avatar:
  - [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/)
  - [Picrew](https://picrew.me/)  (Site is in Japanese, but buttons are decently clear.)

## ‚ö° Instant Messaging Comms (aka Slack) ‚ö°

1. **Use it!** Use it often and keep it open during core hours

1. Always pay attention to the official Ada channels. **We will use this to communicate updates, reminders, and questions.**

1. **Make Slack effective and helpful to you** (see tips)

1. Be responsive
    - When possible, respond as soon as you can, or inform the other person that you will respond later
    - Respond to the best of your ability. Often times, the best response is "I don't know" and "I'm not sure."

1. Be kind

1. Trust others
    - Trust others to respond when they can, as soon as they can, to the best of their ability

1. **Fight against the urge to stay silent when you have something to say/ask**

### Tips

- Mute conversations that you don't want notifications for
- Use "Do Not Disturb" mode on your devices when you don't want to be notified
- Join, create, and leave as many channels that are useful to you!
- Type in a way that is genuine to you: use any writing style, emoji, etc. that feels good

## üìÖ Scheduling/Calendars (aka Google Calendar) üìÖ

This is our source of truth for itinerary per day. **The exception is if we make a more immediate adjustment that is communicated via Slack.**

Every event has a title, length/duration, and event details.

The event details will contain important links, resources, details, etc. **Event details will often include the links to the Zoom call you need to join at that time.**

Here are some events that you will see frequently on your calendar:

- **Checklist**: 8am-9am event. The event details contain everything we expect/hope that you accomplish before the following day. They include:
  - a list of videos to watch
  - a list of readings to watch
  - a list of exercises to complete
  - a list of tasks to complete
- **Lab Time**: Events that indicate time designated for individual work. In the here will always be optional Zoom video links that you can freely join for co-working.
- **Group Activities** such as "Roundtables": Events that indicate a specific group of students meeting. We will communicate group activity assignments through Slack and Email, so check those.

### Tips

- Integrate this calendar with a calendar that you use often

## ‚úâÔ∏è Email (aka Email) ‚úâÔ∏è

Often times we'll email out important information. Please check your email at least once a day.

The staff email addresses are in the Student Handbook.
