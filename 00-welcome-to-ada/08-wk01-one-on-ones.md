# One-on-Ones

One of the systems of support at Ada is one-on-one meetings with a member of the Education Team once every two weeks. One-on-ones are an opportunity for an instructor and student to privately discuss how the classroom environment is going, and progress towards completion of the curriculum.

One-on-one meetings are a private, non-judgemental space. They are an opportunity to discuss anything from technical, to classroom, to career questions. They are also just an opportunity to get to know each other better.

## Logistics

- You will be assigned 3 different one-on-one instructors over the course of the classroom period.
    - One-on-one pairings will change for each major unit (Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript).
- You will begin meeting with your one-on-one instructor during Week 2 (Group A) or Week 3 (Group B).
- You should view your assigned instructor and week group  on the [one-on-one assignment page](https://airtable.com/shropQjvbVoOJEwLu/tblSFL0KogWbkOjyZ).
- You should sign-up for a one-on-one slot when it is assigned using the google calendar checklist. Appointment calendar links are in the [one-on-one assignment page](https://airtable.com/shropQjvbVoOJEwLu/tblSFL0KogWbkOjyZ).
- Meetings will be scheduled for 15 minute time blocks.
    - Please let your instructor know if you think you need more time for the meeting.

We look forward to connecting with you!
