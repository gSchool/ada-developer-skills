# One-on-Ones

One of the systems of support at Ada is bi-weekly one-on-one meetings with a member of the Education Team. One-on-ones are an opportunity for an instructor and student to privately discuss how the classroom environment is going, and progress towards completion of the curriculum.

One-on-one meetings are a private, non-judgemental space. It is an opportunity to discuss anything from technical, to classroom, to career questions. It is also just an opportunity to get to know eachother better.

## Logistics

- You will be assigned 3 different one-on-one instructors over the course of the classroom period.
    - One-on-one pairings will change for each major unit (Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript).
- You will begin meeting with your one-on-one instructor during Week 2 or Week 3.
- Your instructor will reach out to you to schedule a regular meeting every other week.
- Meetings will be scheduled for 15 minute time blocks.
    - Please let your instructor know if you think you need more time for the meeting.

We look forward to connecting with you!
