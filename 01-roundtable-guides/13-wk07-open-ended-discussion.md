# Thursday 10/15 - HTML / CSS Discussion

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

Let's get started with
* What is one website you draw design inspiration from?

This roundtable is a little different.

We're just going to focus on what questions you have about HTML and CSS.

Here are some potential topics to get you started (feel free to go in a different direction though!):

Flexbox and Grid: 
* In what scenarios would you choose to use Flexbox? 
* In what scenarios would you choose to use CSS Grid?
* What are the benefits of each tool?

Imagine a blog website:
* What are some elements for which you would use classes? 
* What are some elements for which you would use ids?
* Why did you make those choices?

Developer Tools:
* What are some ways that your browser's Developer Tools can help you when you're developing a static website with HTML and CSS?
* Have you tried editing the CSS in the browser (either in the Inspector or the Style Editor in Firefox)?
  * Was it helpful?
* Have you used the Grid tool in the Inspector in Firefox?
  * Was it helpful?
