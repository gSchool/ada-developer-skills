# Tuesday 9/22: Classes Review Roundtable

Today's Roundtable will focus on [reviewing classes](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/875/content_files/04-oop/intro-to-classes.md). 

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

Let's get started with
* Share something you did this weekend.
* What questions do you have?
