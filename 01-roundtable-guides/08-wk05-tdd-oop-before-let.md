# TDD (in the OOP exercise) and `before`/`let`

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing TDD, `before` and `let`.

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

Let's get started with
* How did people feel about the exercise?  (Use Zoom annotate.)

  Ugh! <-----------------------------------------------> Great!

* What questions do you have?

Guiding Questions and Concepts to Review:
* Compare solutions to waves 2 and 3.  
  * How did different people solve/approach the problem?
* What are `before` and `let` good for?
* What is the difference between `before` and `let`?
