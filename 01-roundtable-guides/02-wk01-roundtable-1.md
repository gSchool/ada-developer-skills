# Wed 9/2: Random Menu and Study Skills

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing [Random Menu](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/875/content_files/00-variables-data-types/03-wk01-exercise-intro-random-menu.md) and the [Study Techniques Activity](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/09-wk01-activity-study-techniques.md).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

Let's get started with
