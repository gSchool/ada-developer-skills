# Tuesday 10/6: API Review

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing the [fundamentals of APIs](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/875/content_files/06-apis/intro-to-apis.md) in addition to [APIs in Ruby](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/875/content_files/06-apis/apis-in-ruby.md). We can use the [7-wonders activity](https://github.com/Ada-C14/api-exercise-seven-wonders) to ground our review.

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!
