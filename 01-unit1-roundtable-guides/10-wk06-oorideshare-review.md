# OO Ride Share Review

* [OO Ride Share](https://github.com/Ada-C14/oo-ride-share)

* How was the project? (5 minutes)
    * This is a moment to reflect and exhale at the end of the project.

* Which wave are we most interested in talkin about? (Zoom Poll - 2 minutes)
    * Wave 1: Extending Existing Classes
    * Wave 2: Drivers
    * Wave 3: Requesting a Trip
    * Optional Wave 4: Intelligent Dispatching
* Let's share our code. 
    * _Reminder: This is a space where it's safe for people to be wrong, and especially a space where its safe to have imperfect code. We cannot emphasize enough that we all learn from seeing how other people solved a problem._
    * Here are a few ideas to guide our sharing:
        * Share a test or test(s) for edge case(s).
        * Share how you use a `before` or `let` block.
        * Share a place you struggled (along with a breakthrough, or not).
        * Share strategies you used to manage change / additions to your program.
