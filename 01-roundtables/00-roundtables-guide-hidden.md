# Roundtable Structure

## Assignment

* 8 to 9 students per group.
* Groups will rotate every 2 to 3 weeks
  * They will rotate the week after they have met 6 times.
  * They will be notified of their next group the week before.

### Beginning of the Cohort

* The first two groupings will be random within class.
* After the first week of roundtables we will ask time preferences.

## Roundtable Facilitation

The goal for redesigning these was to make the space more interactive and student driven.  Students complained about people not talking/not having answers to the prompts so we are hoping starting with people saying where they are at can get them going and that focusing on answering questions can help with group cohesion.

### Guidelines

* Start with a "temperature check".
  * What is your emotional state?
  * Is there anything you want to share with the group?
* What questions do you have?
* Facilitator should the highlight anything the group should be sure to review.
  * Save some time at the end for this.
