## Capstone Logistics to Review

1. **Days off:** The only holiday during capstone period is President's Day on February 15. Instructors will not be available to support on that day.
1. **Core hours:** You can expect a staff member or volunteer TA to be holding office hours 9:30-12:00 and 1:00-3:00 at a minimum.
1. **Standup Groups:** PMs and Standup groups will be assigned on Tuesday January 26. Standups should occur daily starting Wednesday January 27. Each group is able to choose its own time to meet together.
1. **Standup Form:** There will be a stand-up form you must fill out every day before your group's standup. Your PM will be checking that it was submitted. This helps you and your PM track your progress and helps ensure you're prepared to give a succinct, clear standup update to your group.
1. **Week One:** The first week (Jan 25 - 29) is intended to be primarily learning focused. We encourage people to spend much of that time learning and experimenting with the languages and frameworks they plan to use. Not much progress on building features for the project is necessarily expected during this first week.
1. **Recurring things:**
    - PMs will meet with each individual weekly
    - Accountability groups should demo with each other weekly. Invite the PM to the demo
1. **Code Freeze:** This will be Tuesday February 16th at 5pm. This gives you time to do everything non-code-related that needs to be done for your presentation. (Note: This means there are effectively just over 3 weeks from the first day of capstone - January 25th - and the day of code freeze.)
1. **Optional Lectures and Workshops:** There will be a few optional sessions you can attend if the topic sounds helpful, relevant, or interesting to you! Will will plan to add those to the calendar at least a week in advance.
