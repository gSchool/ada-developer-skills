## Capstone Logistics to Review

1. Days off: The only holiday during capstone period is President's Day on February 15. Instructors will not be available to support on that day.
1. Core hours: You can expect a staff member or volunteer TA to be holding office hours 9:30-12:00 and 1:00-3:00 at a minimum.
1. Remind the students that they must fill out the checkin form/stand-up form every day, or their PMs will sternly get on them
1. PMs and accountability groups will be assigned on Tuesday January 26
1. The first week is intended to be primarily learning focused. TODO: Write more about what this means. Will they still be required to hear from their PM groups? Will they have any access to their PM? If so, how much?
1. Recurring things:
  - PMs will meet with each individual weekly
  - Accountability groups should demo with each other weekly. Invite the PM to the demo
1. Code Freeze Day is Tuesday February 16th at 5pm. This will give you time to do everything non-code-related that needs to be done for your presentation.
1. There will be a few optional sessions you can attend if the topic sounds helpful, relevant, or interesting to you!
