# C14 Capstone Concepts

The first deliverable for the capstone project is the initial concept. This is your first opportunity to share your capstone ideas and research with your instructor.

You should complete this exercise for any ideas that are still in consideration at the time that it is due. You should have __no more than three ideas__ at this stage.

You will then have a 1-1 regarding these concepts on January 19th or 20th.

## Concept Components

1. __Problem Statement__: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve.
1. __Draft Feature Set__: A detailed outline of all major feature sets that will result in the minimum viable product.
1. __Draft Technology Choices__: This does not need to be final, but you should have an idea of what technologies you would like to have in your project's [technology stack](tech-stacks.md).

## Capstone Concept Submission

Use this form to describe 1-3 ideas for your capstone project.

You and an instructor will use your form input to go over your capstone ideas.

You can come back to this form to edit your responses if you save the edit link provided at the end. If you don't save this link, you may need to resubmit the entire form.

You may want to type all of your ideas in your notes, first, then copy/paste them into this form.

**Only Capstone Concept #1 is required**

Refer to our Capstone resources for examples, more information, etc.
