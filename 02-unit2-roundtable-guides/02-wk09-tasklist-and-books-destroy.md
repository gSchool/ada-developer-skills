# Week 9 - LIVE CODE: Task List Wave 1 and Ada Books Destroy

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

Today's Roundtable will focus on an Instructor lead Live Code.

We will go over the implementation for:
 * [Task List - Wave 1](https://github.com/Ada-C14/task-list#wave-1)

While this roundtable is instructor lead, many of our norms still apply:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!
