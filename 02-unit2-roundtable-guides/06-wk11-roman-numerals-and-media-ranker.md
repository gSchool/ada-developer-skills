# Week 10 - Roman Numerals (Exercism) And Media Ranker

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing the [Roman Numerals](https://github.com/exercism/ruby/tree/master/exercises/roman-numerals) [Exercism exercise](https://exercism.io/tracks/ruby) and your questions around [Media Ranker](https://github.com/Ada-C14/media-ranker/).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

## Let's start popcorn style with:
* Everyone should quickly give a brief update describing where you are in the Media Ranker project. Each person's update should be small and quick and 1-3 sentences, much like a stand-up meeting.
    - What is the most recent line of code you wrote that you're proud of?
    - What is the current or upcoming challenge that you need to tackle next?

## Guiding Questions

### Roman Numerals

1. At least two folks should show or talk through their solution of Exercism: Roman Numerals. These two people should be people who have not shared their solution to an Exercism problem before.
    - While people are demoing their solution, those who are watching should be thinking of:
        - at least one question about the code
        - at least one thing that they like about the code

### Media Ranker

1. As a group, share with each other what your project's models and controllers are like. 
  * What models do your projects have? 
  * What are the relationships between these models?
1. What questions and help would you like to ask others about the project?
