# Task List Review

* [Task List](https://github.com/Ada-C14/task-list)

* How was the project? (5 minutes)
    * This is a moment to reflect and exhale at the end of the project.

* Which wave are we most interested in talking about? (Zoom Poll - 2 minutes)
    * Wave 1 - Index
    * Wave 2 - Show
    * Wave 3 - Update
    * Wave 4 - Delete / Mark Complete


Guided Review
* For the *Mark Complete* feature, let's look at a version that uses a single method, and a version that uses two separate methods.
    * Why would we use two separate methods?
* Name an edge case test for the `delete` and `mark_complete` actions and show your test(s).
