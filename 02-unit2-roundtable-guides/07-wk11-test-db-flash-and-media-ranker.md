# Week 10 - Test DB, Flash And Media Ranker

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing the [Test DB](http://example.com/LINK-TBD), [Flash](http://example.com/LINK-TBD), and your questions around [Media Ranker](https://github.com/Ada-C14/media-ranker/).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

## Let's start popcorn style with:
* Everyone should quickly give a brief update describing where you are in the Media Ranker project. Each person's update should be small and quick and 1-3 sentences, much like a stand-up meeting.
    - What is the most recent line of code you wrote that you're proud of?
    - What is the current or upcoming challenge that you need to tackle next?

## Guiding Questions

### The Test Database

1. What is the test database, and how is it different from the development database (the database accessed when running the Rails server and visiting `localhost:3000`)?
1. What is the relationship between fixtures and the test database?
1. In Media Ranker, how will the test database be used? 
  * Use concrete and specific examples when possible.

### Flash

1. As a group, come up with a definition for `flash` in your own words
1. As a group, come up with a definition for `flash.now` in your own words. How does it differ from `flash` in syntax and use case?
1. In Media Ranker, how will `flash` be used?
1. Share code: If anyone has an example of `flash` being used in a controller action (even if it's not working or in-progress), share with the group! Practice talking through your code. Feel free to use this time to ask questions, especially if you don't have `flash` working.

### Media Ranker

1. As a group, share with each other some challenges solved during the project:
  * How did you identify the problem?
  * How did you solve it?
    * Did someone help you with your solution?
1. What questions and help would you like to ask others about the project?
