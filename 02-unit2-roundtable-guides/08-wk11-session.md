# Week 10 - Session

Please [submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrOEPwWbMZXxXlTt) the day before the roundtable discussion group.

---

Today's Roundtable will focus on reviewing the [Sesssion](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/1006/content_files/intro-to-rails-3/session.md) and your questions around [Media Ranker](https://github.com/Ada-C14/media-ranker/).

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should follow the [Ada Online Communication Norms](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2036/blocks/882/content_files/00-welcome-to-ada/02-wk01-online-communication-norms.md)
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
* When discussing code, you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
* Take notes!

## Review Questions

1. As a group, come up with a definition for `session` in your own words, and how it helps with log-in functionality
1. As a group, come up with a description for how `session` helps with log-in functionality
1. How would our controller tests be affected by log-in functionality?
1. How does someone "clear" the contents of `session`...
    - in our Rails code?
    - in our browser?
1. Share code: If anyone has an example of `session` being used in a controller action (even if it's not working or in-progress), share with the group! Practice talking through your code. Feel free to use this time to ask questions, especially if you don't have `session` working.
