# Git Push-Pull Activity

In this classroom lesson we will work in pairs to complete [git pull activity](https://github.com/Ada-C14/git-pull-activity).  In this lesson you will learn how to pull changes from a remote repository and resolve differences between a local and remote repository, called merge-conflicts.  A _merge conflict_ is when git is trying to combine two sets of changes, but cannot determine how to combine some or all changes.  Git then lets you resolve the changes.

## Instructor Introduction & Modeling

To start the instructor will demonstrate:

1.  Forking the initial repository
1.  Adding a collaborator to their version of the git-pull-activty repo
1.  Demonstrate with their collaborator how one partner can push changes to github and the second partner can pull down those changes.
1.  Then demonstrate what happens when git cannot resolve those changes.

## Breakout Rooms

The instructor will divide the class into breakout rooms of 2-3 students.  Each room will follow the steps in the activity to practice using `git push` and `git pull` to share changes and practice resolving merge conflicts.
